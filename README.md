📊 IPL Data Analysis Project | Data Science & Visualization
I’m excited to share one of my recent projects: IPL (Indian Premier League) Data Analysis! 🏏
In this project, I explored and analyzed IPL datasets to uncover key insights and trends related to:
Top-performing players and teams
Toss impact on match outcomes
Most successful venues
Batsmen vs bowlers performance stats
Year-wise team performance
🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook for code and presentation
💡 Key Highlights:
Created interactive visualizations to present player and team performance
Derived actionable insights using data wrangling and EDA techniques
Developed a deeper understanding of how data can be used in sports analytics
This project helped me sharpen my data analysis, visual storytelling, and Python programming skills.
 I'm passionate about using data to tell compelling stories—and cricket was the perfect subject! 🧠📈
